Most people cannot control this energy, and as a result, continually release it. The accumulation of uncontrolled Cursed Energy gives rise to Curses (呪い, Noroi), malevolent spiritual entities driven to harm humanity. These Curses often manifest as grotesque monsters, drawing on traditional Japanese folklore, such as onryō (vengeful spirits), yūrei (ghosts), and yōkai.

    (2,'Chainsaw Man','12-03-2018','The series is set in the late 1990s, in an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists. In this world, Devils (悪魔, Akuma) are born from the collective fears of humanity. Specialized operatives known as Devil Hunters (デビルハンター, Debiru Hantā) are tasked with eliminating them and often form contracts with them to gain their abilities or powers in return. A Devil possessing a human body (usually deceased) is known as a Fiend, while certain individuals can become hybrids via merging with Devils. Devils are capable of reincarnation, cycling between Hell and Earth: when one dies on Earth, it reappears in Hell, and when killed there, it returns to Earth. A unique exception to this cycle is the Chainsaw Devil, whose consumption of another Devil permanently erases the concept that Devil represented from both existence and human memory. As a result, the Holocaust, AIDS, and nuclear weapons are completely forgotten. ','Tatsuki Fujimoto','Viz Media','Default.png','Ongoing','NULL'),

    (5,'Solo Leveling','07-25-2016','In a world where hunters – human warriors who possess supernatural abilities – battle deadly monsters to protect all mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jin-woo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful and rare double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called The System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the unique ability to level up in strength which is something no other hunter is able to do, as a hunter''s abilities are set and don''t "level up" once they awaken. Jin-woo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers. He soon discovers that he has been chosen to inherit the position of Shadow Monarch, essentially turning him into an immortal necromancer known as the "King of the Dead" who has absolute rule over the dead, created by a god while in the middle of the war between its two creations of light and dark, the Rulers and the Monarch. He is the only Monarch who fights to save humanity, as the other Monarchs, who are actually the leaders of all monsters, are trying to kill him and wipe out the humans.
